# Frank's GitHub Profile

I'll use this area to keep track of my web development learning process. Areas will be divided into ??? (I don't know what it is), exposure (I've heard of it), usage (I know what it does and I've used it at least once), familiarity (I've used it in a variety of situations), mastery (I've been challenged in it), professional (I make money with it)
